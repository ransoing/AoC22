## [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) solutions in typescript

I'm aiming for solutions that have few lines of code while being reasonably readable.

Set up by installing [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) and running `npm i` in the repo's directory.

Before running any of the code, you'll need to copy your puzzle input into this repo for the relevant day you want to solve.

Run with `npm run solve [day number]`, i.e. `npm run solve 1` for day 1's puzzle.

If the `solve` script doesn't work, use `npm run solveAlt -- src/day1/solution.ts`, or substitute the number for any number from 1-25.
